Combining both the Boltzmann and Saha equations and considering only transition
from n=1 to n=2 and from neutral to ionized Hydrogen (i.e. neglecting
all n > 2 states):
1. Turn in a graph (computer generated, excel is ok) of the Nn=2/Ntotal vs
temperature states. The x-axis should display temperatures from 5,000 K
to 25,000 K, the y-axis should run from 0 to 1.
